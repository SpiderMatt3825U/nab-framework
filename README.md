nab-framework
=============

This is a higher level abstraction of various Zend Framework components in an effort to provide a more application ready skeleton.

Currently the code base is being updated with all of the appropriate licensing information and file formatting is being cleaned up with appropriate documentation added. Once these updates are complete I will commit the codebase and add licensing information for both commercial and non-commercial use.
